# SimpleNeuralNetwork

This is a very simple neural network that offers a Keras-like API.
It has only the bare-bone features someone would expect to find in a neural network, namely:
  1. Optimization with backpropagation
  2. Layers
  3. Activation and loss functions support
  
Also, the neural network is designed to be as extensible as possible thanks to the OOP architecture that was used and it has some basic tests to ease refactoring/expanding.

There's an example for XOR gate learning using the network as well.
